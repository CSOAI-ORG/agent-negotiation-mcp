| `evaluate_offer` | Evaluate an offer using negotiation theory (BATNA, ZOPA, Nash). |
| `counter_offer` | Submit a counter-offer on an existing negotiation. |
| `run_auction` | Run a simulated auction. Bids as JSON: [{"bidder": "A", "amount": 100}, ...] |
| `negotiation_status` | Get status of a negotiation or list all active negotiations. |

## Installation

```bash
pip install meok-agent-negotiation-mcp
```

## Pairs with MEOK Governance Suite

Build something that touches users? You need compliance. MEOK ships 38 governance MCPs that drop in alongside this tool — EU AI Act, DORA, NIS2, CRA, GDPR, ISO 42001, FDA SaMD, MDR, Basel, MiFID II, MiCA, COPPA, and more.

```bash
# One-shot install of the governance pack
npx meok-setup --pack governance
```

Free tier: 10 calls/day per MCP. Pro tier (£79/mo): unlimited + cryptographically signed compliance attestations your auditor verifies independently.
